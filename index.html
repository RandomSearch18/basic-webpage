    <h1>The USB Type-C connector is great</h1>
    Introduced in 2014, USB-C is a highly-versatile, easy-to-use connector that
    can be found on everything from desktops and laptops to mobiles and external
    SSDs. This simple webpage will outline some of its key advantages.

    <h2>Always the right way up</h2>
    Unlike the USB connectors that came before it, USB-C has
    <i>rotational symmetry</i>. Therefore, it'll work properly no matter which
    way up you plug it in. This eliminates the years of training previously
    required before you're able to insert it correctly every time.

    <h2>One connector to rule them all</h2>
