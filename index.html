    <h1>The USB Type-C connector is great</h1>
    Introduced in 2014, USB-C is a highly-versatile, easy-to-use connector that
    can be found on everything from desktops and laptops to mobiles and external
    SSDs. This simple webpage will outline some of its key advantages.

    <h2>Always the right way up</h2>

    Unlike the USB connectors that came before it, USB-C has
    <i>rotational symmetry</i>. Therefore, it'll work properly no matter which
    way up you plug it in. This eliminates the years of training previously
    required before you're able to insert it correctly every time.

    <h2>One connector to rule them all</h2>

    While USB-C connectors are often used to provide low-voltage power and
    mediocre data transfer speeds, they are capable of much more beyond that. A
    few examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Data transfer at speeds up to 20 Gbps under the USB 3.2 standard</li>
      <li>
        Supplying up to 240 watts of power with the
        <abbr title="USB Power Delivery (revision 3.1)">USB PD 3.1</abbr>
        standard
      </li>
      <li>
        Connecting to 4K monitors by "tunneling" a DisplayPort connection
        through a USB cable
      </li>
      <li>
        You can even connect external GPUs through
        <abbr title="PCI Express">PCIe</abbr> tunneling
      </li>
    </ul>

    Another advantage of USB-C is that the same connector is used by host
    devices (which previously used USB-A) and peripherals (previously served by
    USB-B), simplifying the types of cables you'll need. In fact, the new USB4
    standard has USB-C as its only supported connector &mdash; further
    demonstrating its broad capabilities.
